// Introduction to arrays, a type of variable used in many computer programs to store data.

// Since an array may contain multiple elements, it's good to name the array plurally (for example, `movies`).

const movies = ["The Wolf of Wall Street", "Palm Springs", "Scarface", "The Killing FIelds"];
console.log(movies.length); // 4

const emptyArray = [];
console.log(emptyArray.length); // 0
